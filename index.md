## About Me

I am a first-year CS PhD student at University of California, Davis, advised by Prof. [Lifu Huang](https://wilburone.github.io/). My primary research topic is enhancing reasoning and understanding of foundation models. I mostly focus on developing better algorithms for language models to handle complex reasoning and self training tasks, while studying their current limitations.
Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my MS in Operations Research at Virginia Tech, and obtained my BS from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/). 

If you're interested in my research, would like to discuss relevant topics, or explore potential collaborations, please feel free to get in touch :) - I am best reached by email at [mbeigi@ucdavis.edu](mailto:mbeigi@ucdavis.edu)
